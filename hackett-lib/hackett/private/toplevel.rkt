; This module implements #%top-interaction for the Hackett REPL. It does some tricks to make Hackett
; forms cooperate more nicely with the top level while still being able to do things like print the
; types of expressions evaluated at the REPL.
;
; The fundamental problem is that Hackett relies heavily on compile-time bindings and local-expand,
; but compile-time bindings are complicated at the top level. For example, imagine a macro being
; expanded with local-expand produces the following form:
;
;   (begin
;     (define-syntax x <expr>)
;     (some-macro x))
;
; If some-macro calls local-expand on the x provided as a subform, the result will be an unbound
; identifier error, since the (define-syntax ....) form has not yet been evaluated.
;
; This is only a problem, however, if the code in question is being expanded with local-expand. At the
; top level, when the expander sees a (begin ....) form, it will intelligently evaluate the forms in
; order *before* proceeding to expand subsequent forms. This is a problem, however, because we *need*
; to expand subsequent forms in order to check what the final expression’s type is to print type
; information.
;
; To fix this, we can implement a sort of “trampoline” in #%top-interaction that will perform partial
; expansion until we are sure we are dealing with an expression. For example, imagine the user submits
; the following form at the REPL:
;
;   > (m1 x)
;
; This will be wrapped by the expander in our #%top-interaction, so the entire form will be this:
;
;   (#%top-interaction m1 x)
;
; Now, in this case, m1 may be a macro. To find out, we can perform partial expansion using
; local-expand with (kernel-form-identifier-list) as the stop list. This may produce an expression, in
; which case we’re finished, and we can print the expression’s type if it has one. If we have a
; definition, we’re also finished, and we can expand to the definition without doing anything else. If
; we have a begin, on the other hand, we need to be more clever. Imagine (m1 x) expands into the
; following:
;
;   (begin
;     (define-syntax x0 <expr>)
;     (m2 x x0))
;
; Crucially, we *cannot* call local-expand on (m2 x x0), because if we do, it will be expanded in a
; context without the x0 compile-time binding available! Instead, we need to yield to the expander,
; which we can do by expanding to the following:
;
;   (begin
;     (define-syntax x0 <expr>)
;     (#%top-interaction m2 x x0))
;
; The expander will evaluate the top level definition, then yield control back to our
; #%top-interaction, and we can continue the partial expansion process.
;
; Much of this process is similar to the process performed by the functions in syntax/toplevel, but
; that module uses expand-syntax-to-top-form instead of local-expand, and it evaluates forms with
; eval-syntax in the current namespace instead of yielding control to the expander. That avoids the
; need to trampoline, but it isn’t possible to use during the extent of #%top-interaction’s expansion,
; since we are at phase 1, but the forms need to be evaluated at phase 0.
